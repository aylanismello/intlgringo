The most standout experience from my entire stay in Myanmar is, without a doubt, the three days I spent trekking from the small town of Kalaw to Inle Lake. While a trip to Inle Lake seems to be a must on anyone's itinerary while in Myanmar, I think that the trek itself is more beautiful, hands on, and gives you a truer sense of the region's character than just the final destination of Inle itself.

This gorgeous landscape can be yours <3

So let's get into it.

### A quick sidenote

Opt for the 3 day/2 night trek. The first day of the trek offered, even taking into account all the independent variables of the trip, the most lush and scenic landscapes. The 2 day/1 night option skips over the first day of hiking through the valley which connects Kalaw to the neighboring foothills, which means that views like the one below will not able to be seen by you (which would be devastating).

### Starting from Kalaw

There are a few towns to begin your trek to Inle Lake from, but Kalaw is by far the most recommended. Kalaw is a small, rural town located in Shan state. By itself it doesn't have much to offer, therefore it's advised to use it as a spot to rest up and organize your hiking excursion the day prior to. Kalaw can be reached by bus from either Bagan or Mandalay in about 6-7 hours, depending on the seemingly mandatory delay (Burmese transport is notoriously late, but hey, what's the rush? ðŸ˜›).

I bused in from Bagan on what was a surprisingly smooth ride. The price was something in the neighborhood of 10,000 kyat / 6$ USD for a mini bus. I ended up staying at one of the few hostels in town called [Hostel Roma](https://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Hostel-Roma-Inn/Kalaw/283504). The facilities are simple but functional, and they work closely with one the largest trekking companies in town called [Jungle Trekking](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1016308-d13005141-Reviews-Jungle_King_Trekking_Guide_Services-Kalaw_Shan_State.html?m=19905). It was with Jungle Trekking that I ventured out to Inle, the day after I got in.

### Day 1: The trek begins

This was the first fully organized, group trekking experience of my life. Group trekking as done by my company was actually quite wonderful - they handled almost all of the most mundane aspects of trekking, eg. setting up the places to sleep, preparing all meals, and transporting large bags to our final destination. 

It also didn't hurt that my group, by pure chance, ended up being rather small and only full of excellent, chill people. Upon leaving Kalaw, passing through the day market and then the old railroad station, we began to venture into what would be the closest look I would get to traditional tribal society and rural villages in Myanmar.

Passing through the local market in Kalaw

There seemed to be a healthy co-existence between the Shan people we came across and the tourists that pour through the villages daily. Our guide, who called himself Pedro (but whose lack of any Latino origins made me then call him by his true name: Hsein-Pe), was a living, breathing encyclopedia on all the nuances and minutiae of the various tribes and customs we came across. From explaining the significance of the altars that some of the few Animilsim-practicing ethnic groups, to cluing me in on what my Burmese spirit animal is based on the day of the week I was born (it's this dope mythical bird), there didn't seem much he was unable to answer.

The whole day was a mix of stunning landscapes, a slowly deepening understand of the richness and immense diversity of the peoples of Myanmar, and good conversation. As if I didn't learn enough about how the locals lived in villages we crossed through, the day ended with a homestay (also a first for me). 

One of the single most amazing days of my life, without hyperbole. Thanks Pedro!

### Day 2: The trek continues.

Up bright and early the following day, it was time to keep on moving through another beautiful, but not quite as stunning, series of landscapes. The final destination on Day 2 was a monastery up in the mountains which would serve as our resting place.

Note my friend, the buffalo, on the right-hand side

Sleeping at a monastery is a pretty surreal experience. I'm not sure what confused me more, the fact that they were selling beer just a few meters from the monastery and most of other groups were drinking in the dining hall, or the fact that I saw young novice monks chasing each other with toy guns (I would've done anything for picture of that moment, unfortunately I could not capture a decent pic).

### Day 3: All good things must end - arriving in Inle Lake

Awoken at the crack of dawn by the sound of chanting monks, it was time to finish strong and get to Inle. The landscape became increasingly less hilly and increasingly paved, which made for some pretty disappointing views. Walking along the main road which led to the official entrance to the Inle Recreation area, we were prompted to pay 10,000 kyat / 6$ USD to enter the area surrounding Inle Lake.

When we arrived at a small town built on water that connected to the lake, things started getting interesting once more. After lunch there, we were boat taxied past the canal into the lake at last.

### Wrap up

For a total price of 38,000 kyat / 23$ USD - doing this type of trekking activity is about the cheapest thing you could do given the experience. I couldn't recommend it highly enough, there's not feeling quite as satisfying as coming out of those 3 days hiking and finally getting there. Especially when I hardly had to carry any of my own luggage ðŸ”¥
