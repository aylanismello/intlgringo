#Some Thoughts on Long Term Solo Travel

When I tell people that I travel alone, I usually get some variant of the "Oh, really?" response.

But when I fess up that I travel alone for months on end, their reaction evolves into a more incredulous "but how do you manage to do it?". And then the question of loneliness inevitably comes up. "But isn't it SO lonely?"

Well, yes and no. There are some definite pros and cons to solo traveling, and some of them didn't appear as obvious as I would've expected. 

Being in constant contact with everyone from back home is expected. You have to choose to truly be with yourself, but inevitably the feeling sinks in. Your phone might be off the hook with "how have you been"s and IG likes, but it's just you on the receiving end. And sure, you could choose to opt to disconnect from the world, not get a SIM card - great. But in my opinion that's not sustainable in the long run - if working while traveling and not vacationing, staying connected becomes necessary.

# Wrap Up

Long term solo travel probably isn't for everyone. You're forced to sit with yourself, be with yourself, in ways that we hardly are accustomed to in the midst of the 9-5 grind. 

But all that pales in comparison to arriving to a new city, alone, unbounded, unrestricted in what to do or where to go. And when I do feel down and out, I try to tap into how incredible that feeling is, and how it never gets old. And it makes it all worth the while.
