# The logistics of elephant bathing üêòüõÅ (a visit to a Thai elephant sanctuary)

The ethical gray area-turned major tourism attraction called elephant sanctuaries is a must on any visit to Thailand. I'll skip over any sort of moral debates on the validity of this type of tourism, suffice it to say that I did my homework and made sure the elephants I was visiting were spoiled af and living great elephant lives.

They were.

### üêò From Chiang Mai to the Elephant land üêò

While staying in Chiang Mai, I was shuttled to the hills further North, with everything being taken care of through a company called [Blue Daily](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293917-d11762930-Reviews-Blue_Daily_Elephant_Care-Chiang_Mai.html). One thing that stood out to me from their reviews is that elephants run the show - they seem to be really taken care of and respected. Upon arriving we were introduced to the first elephants, a mother-son duo feasting upon some forest vegetation.

We were taught the subtle differences between male and female elephants, how to tell an African elephant from the Thai variety, as well as many other fun elephant facts. All of which I promptly forgot and didn't bother to note down. Sorry.

### A light hike with the elephants ‚õ∞üö∂üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüêòüêòüêò

For anybody that's lost motivation on a hike, there's nothing quite like a two-ton creature gently coming up from behind you to keep you moving.

As some may already know, elephant riding is [a big no-no in Thailand](https://theculturetrip.com/asia/thailand/articles/instagram-bans-elephant-riding-photos-protect-wildlife/), having recently fallen out of favor due to the adverse health impacts it had on elephants, many of them being overworked to exhaustion. So instead of riding them, we hiked with them. It's practical too, they have a nice open patch of vegetation to munch on one we reached the top of our short climb.

### The changing role of elephants in Thai society üáπüá≠üêòüöÄ

I don't want to make any brash, grandiose claims; but from what I've gathered, elephants, at least symbolically, are kind of a Big Deal‚Ñ¢Ô∏è in Thailand. From their presence on temples, clothing, and art, it's non clich√© to see them as a kind of fundamental piece of Thai identity.

But the truth is, wild elephants don't exist in Thailand anymore.

Elephants-turned manual laborers during the epoch of enormous growth of the Thai lumber industry

During the period of country wide deforestation, elephants were used as the grand manual laborers in the forests. By this time,  all wild elephants were practically gone. Then began a period of transforming the role of elephants from workers to tourism profiteers. The fact is, none of the elephants remaining in Thailand could survive much in the wild, as they are heavily domesticated and co-exist with humans. The emergence of sanctuaries as the dominant business enterprise seems to strike a good balance between finding a place for elephants in modern Thai society without overtly exploiting them, but maybe something new and exiting will develop in the future. I have no clue.

For posterity, let me add that all of this information is anecdotal and from my guide, by the way, so feel free to holler at me if I got any of the details wrong.

### For the grand finaleüõÅüêò

So how does one bathe an elephant, you ask? Why, just toss your flip flops to the side, meekly follow one of your guides shouting in Thai and get in the river!
