# First Impressions of Chiang Mai

I've spent the last week in Chiang Mai, cultural capital of the Northern Thailand and [home of this sweet lantern festival which I literally missed by a couple days](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Loi_Krathong#/Yi_Peng) (fuck).

Being my first time in Thailand, I suppose many of these first impressions are of the country more than anything else, but I don't know if I'd want to generalize so fast. In any event, I'd be remiss not to start off by mentioning that -

### Yeah, there are a lot of foreigners

The secret got out, and now there are more than a handful of *farangs* living in and visiting Chiang Mai. Indeed, it has experienced an unprecedented level of growth in tourism and expat relocation in recent years - it's this same hype fostered on the inter-webs that led me to Southeast Asia to begin with. What makes it all the more striking is that Chiang Mai is no megacity - in 2018 it only [had a population of around 160,000](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Chiang_Mai). 

![yo](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GdtT_ywPaq6IpWw-KA2eFgKcOHJCyJyYqfeFadvTQB-EshbOHK8MZA5sGQ_AhAawHGjqVprXNfmVzLrKPHVRE_lXbRojozQcUxxoGw82wT_2QwmxJWlo57WRpVSJiJH1CusjpwEnNKDsA3V_jD_6Sd9zrgNdzePk0I3J2qgJlV4v4rqlK0zA84B_U5e8LVIgt5CzvnwWgrHy57dNgj3UZSF2JfJZI2qr75-DyPqnkODC0BoXns_DeGrYW6PzDqXsFkgCzRXwYW2KnzkpFpQSQOTnBUyK6adaEu6ZakNHw3pbz1sz96LM--kEfth12KWW6u-GJ4UP-2LHyZmE0G1PtEtKBy0O4Ms8MlAQmR0xzYHXcuLk-92wgnl8FzUXVvULVXFtsVXvwbPHNBcXwroxbnimdk37F4NvM5dN4T0VV9qQU7W-jDKkLjJQA30BIdgrdC3Oi6YMz-tTW1QiJXGRDul-2BT7WhJQkYItu4tc2rWZKFArFZ0MV9zdDuhekA21mykRle_yeOWr8Xv6iOk5hn4k3azRNhLbtBLM_qjDJThtp1JPZJm9Jf5UzUmDxJLAieKQmB3VTkO_VJDJfOtuXGkkhtUv2l9UGPIX7Mi9kQlGzKGKaoMHOdILXv84Im2A6chV8i5xNQyImOMDRM7Df2IJqg=s1606-no)





So the farangs really, really stand out. This in turn means that -

### It's easy to figure out

As a result of getting accustomed to the sheer amount of Westerners in the city, Chiang Mai is truly a delight to navigate and figure out should you not speak fluent Thai. Menus are written in English alongside Thai, locals are more than happy to lend a helping hand, transport is abundant within Chiang Mai and to other cities, and accommodations are plentiful - varying from luxurious villas to humble hostels (you'll find me in the latter). 

### Temples abound the city

To say Chiang Mai has many temples would be an understatement. The last time I mistakenly came across so many temples on my way home must've been in Kyoto. It's as if you don't go to the temples, they come to you 🕍

If you're like me and not totally temple jaded, you could definitely spend something in the neighborhood of two days just getting lost and exploring the ornate beauty of all of these structures. 

### The food is consistently phenomenal 

I've eaten out every single meal for the last week and only had one bad culinary experience (and it's when I decided to try out Japanese food. How can you screw up yakisoba?). Every single other Thai offering has ranged from good to fucking fantastic.

From Pad Thai, to Papaya Salad (som tam) and some of the tastiest curry I've ever tried, Chiang Mai is a foodie haven. And unless you're a picky eater (vegan, can't eat spicy, etc) or a financial masochist (eg. decide to eat gourmet hamburgers and other western nonsense in a small Thai city) you could easily go out for lunch and spend less than 50 Baht, which is roughly 1.50 USD. Which of course leads me to....

### The prices 💸

I remember being in southern Mexico and spending 3-4 dollars on lunch and thinking - "well damn. this is as good as it gets." Well, I may have spoken too soon - it was also in Mexico that I was told of a mythical land, with similarly delicious spicy food which made Mexican prices seem sky high. It was there that the seed for Thailand was born.

`my shock and amazement at the marvels of México. in front of Tule, widest tree on Earth`

The legends were real. Chiang Mai is, without a doubt, the cheapest city I have ever been to. And cheap doesn't imply low quality, so get rid of all those negative connotations right now. Cheap is economical. Cheap is the difference between your trip lasting one week versus three. My first hostel put me down ~200 Baht / night, roughly 6 USD (and this isn't even the cheapest you could find if you're super shoestring). Domestic 12oz beer at 7-11? 1$ USD. Bottle of water?  0.50  \$ USD. And the list goes on.

The one place I've seen that tends to escape the gravitational pull of these great prices are the cafes. Especially those designed for studying, working, etc. Which of course brings me to -

### Those work cafes tho

I consider my current style of travel to be a work/vacation hybrid - I work remotely three days a week, sight-seeing and working on personal projects (such as this wonderful article) on those many free times in between. Consequently, cafes are of the utmost importance, not only to vary up my workspace but also to people watch (an underrated but highly useful activity in understanding a culture).

One of the standout features of Chiang Mai is the abundance not only of many high quality cafes designed for work/studying, but also the incredible internet infrastructure (more on that later).

I've found everything from cozy, artsy cafes for lounging to 24/7 co-working cafes with bustling energy and crazy cool interior design. In this regard, one is truly spoiled here. Expect to spend around 75-150 Baht (3 - 4.50USD) for a drink to get you started, which as mentioned, is one slight deviation from the regularly out of this world prices, but you could find cheaper coffee elsewhere. You're really paying for the atmosphere anyhow if you're heading for one of these cafes. But chances are, if you're in Chiang Mai as a tourist, you didn't come to sit in a cafe and write excellent banter. After all -

### You're surrounded by forest 🌳

There are so many options for day trip activities in the outskirts of Chiang Mai, you're enveloped by the surrounding forests on North Thailand. Hiking, white water rafting, ATVs, whatever you're into, it's not far. Even from the balcony of one of my go-to co-working cafes you could get a sense for the blanket of green that wraps the city.

Concrete day trips I've taken range from [elephant sanctuaries](/blog/a-visit-to-a-thai-elephant-sanctuary) to temples located up in the surrounding mountains, such as the renowed Doi Suthep.

![doi suthep](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mX7Fyi2w7kXjpcZadHTnc7tH8QrbNYukMrDC0shx6zOJcnmbt3Ke8kb34Wx9f3TPbBZQvxv-cRbLOo-E-0GOVbwQnnLZm5VlluPvdKL6cUoB3VBGSYSFhALtbT65EiUa9uS4S1ocP6vIWckjVnC6Z0Zxioxp4mhAo7UDBQygQvXzq-Q8IjWC5-MDb4GYySKFqG0lFxlHBZ_CGLEShUSRtAJZs1doWZVkJrAyezKtB0AZktIEcBGx1DI5brMm0nQDEO9IeXFZKPVcav_O5sQQ132fFCJDI41ZH4g-qlWjHWpr4S4y8qd_n4rjtNC5x9DjUynZUl5jaEsX3M88pluwwDf4rZ5L03sL8brQoWWdhzI5287HcHDI4wfoIRXyu3qOWl_Mf8xCyoM6o9HfA_SvjUAbMYo5By_Bp8OgD3a_GR0xnEUeIPM4PVOOib86gEYXiVT0wkZT7eWYh3AqegKP9egQt7oyucjrk6CcQ2MakMt0vzK2tFKqJcNjuoQ-O3fUHALNdVDDX4j5idTIwpD4Np6i6gCaxaPQRGR8HBKOEw78BmCKkimiyhhiECN7pPFVEU6vROJR8bXwalW84m0cQM8gLolFy1VlapLs-wwIf4Np4QLuvPbEJe-1xNMVQ_tgdBlFhFlaWUobLIdAPv9YbQBDww=w780-h1040-no)

I've saved the worst for last; it's a theme commonly explored in Southeast Asia in. particular, but something new to me. I'm referring to -

### The sexpats

I myself am not a lanky, middle aged European with a receding hairline and no sense of self-dignity - so I don't know if I could empathize with these particular creatures that I've come across again and again during my brief stay in Chiang Mai. But if the preponderance of them here is any indication, I'm about to be in for seeing many more across Southeast Asia. Also, here's a sexpat definition from urban dictionary I decided to include because it's wonderful.


> Usually referring to a creepy, fat and balding white male who goes to Asia (often Southeast Asia) to exploit his white privilege, favorable currency exchange rate and host countries' colonial legacy to have sex with the local Asian women there. A sex tourist on an extended stay. These men have no game in their home countries and typically had low level jobs back home. Before they leave for Asia, you'll find these types on The Red Pill ranting about how Western women do not appreciate how much of a nice guy they are. They are the ones who give WMAF relationships a bad name, and any hapa child that results from these encounters tend to develop severe mental illness when they reach adulthood realizing they are a product of sexual fetishism and white supremacy.

The openness with which the sexpats frolic around down with their 'partners' really surprised me, but I guess this is more an indication of how blissfully ignorant I've been. I could only imagine the sights I'll see in Bangkok. Oh, my.

### Fin

So there you have it! I'm excited to dig into specific experiences from my stay here and write in more depth. As far as a place to get your first glimpse into Thai culture, its people, environment, and food, I think it's safe to say that Chiang Mai is an excellent choice.
