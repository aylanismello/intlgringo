# Welcome to Myanmar ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡²: (The Abandoned Amusement Park in Yangon that was the highlight of my stay there)



*Disclaimer*

> Before deciding to head over to Myanmar, it's wise to get up to date on the situation regarding the many conflicts in the country. The largest one is the plight of the Rohingya people in Rakhine state (western Myanmar on the border with Bangladesh), which [the UN classified as a genocide last year](https://www.economist.com/news/2018/08/28/the-un-reports-that-the-assault-on-the-rohingyas-amounted-to-genocide). Also consider that many city attractions, recreation areas, temple zones, require an entrance fee which makes its way to the government financing these heinous acts. I did the math and figured it was still worth it, but as always, it's always better to be well informed prior to the fact so that you can plan your stay accordingly and don't end up having any delayed ethical dilemmas.

Note how close Chiang Mai, Thailand is to her western neighbor, Myanmar. Pretty damn close right? Yeah, that's what I thought too. A quick google search and painless [e-visa](https://evisa.moip.gov.mm/) process later, I was in. Yangon, to be precise.

### A whole lotta city

Maybe the first thing you'll take note of in Yangon is that, well - goddamn it's a big city. Like *7 million people living there* big. I ended up staying in the Chinatown neighborhood (alas, there truly are Chinatowns in every country in the world!) which was recommended due to its proximity to local food markets  / deliciousness. But this isn't about my stay, or the more obvious tourist attractions I digested during my stay. Rather, this is about the most interesting and definitive thing one must do should they sojourn in Yangon. And that's going  this spooky ass abandoned amusement park. But first...

### You have to find the entrance. There are many, but this worked for me

Here's another picture of a map. The blue pin is where I entered the amusement park, it's at the back of a parking lot on the southwest corner of the Yangon zoo and it should be  full of vans, buses, taxis, etc.

Tourists pass through this way to enter all the time, so don't worry about making a fuss or disturbing the people working in and around the lot, it's perfectly normal. Upon reaching the back right corner of the parking lot, you should see a fence falling apart with a large gap you could just walk right pass. Do that, and say 'Mingalabar' to the mostly harmless stray dogs guarding the spot. You're in.

### The good part

There's something surreal and oddly enjoyable about this type of urban exploration, beholding what amounts to essentially modern ruins. I won't get too into the history of the amusement park, but suffice it to say, it's super abandoned now, and nobody seems to have cleaned up any of it, really. You could easily spend 1 hour+ just exploring the grounds, and taking those coveted pics for your IG posts.

### Yagon in general tho

I don't think Yangon has anything special to offer for travelers to Myanmar. Sure, they have the famous [Shwedagon Pagoda](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Shwedagon_Pagoda), and you could call me a blasphemous heretic but that just doesn't cut it for me. Myanmar must have tens of thousands of pagodas, from the most remote mountainside villages to other major cities. I wouldn't go out of my way for it, but, should you be like many travelers and find yourself in Yangon, either having just flown in, or passing through, don't overlook this gem of urban decay / urban exploration. It truly is justification for being in the city at all. But wait, [isn't there a website dedicated to just the sort of vibe?](https://www.atlasobscura.com/)

Happy travels :)
