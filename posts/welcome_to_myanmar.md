> Before deciding to head over to Myanmar, it's wise to get up to date on the situation regarding the many conflicts in the country. The largest one is the plight of the Rohingya people in Rakhine state (western Myanmar on the border with Bangladesh), which [the UN classified as a genocide last year](https://www.economist.com/news/2018/08/28/the-un-reports-that-the-assault-on-the-rohingyas-amounted-to-genocide). Also consider that many city attractions, recreation areas, temple zones, require an entrance fee which makes its way to the government financing these heinous acts. I did the math and figured it was still worth it, but as always, it's always better to be well informed prior to the fact so that you can plan your stay accordingly and don't end up having any delayed ethical dilemmas.

### From Thailand to Myanmar
Check out this map.

Note how close Chiang Mai, Thailand is to her western neighbor, Myanmar. Pretty damn close right? Yeah, that's what I thought too. A quick google search and painless [e-visa](https://evisa.moip.gov.mm/) process later, I was in. Yangon, to be precise.

### Starting in Yangon
Maybe the first thing you'll take note of in Yangon is that, well - goddamn it's a big city. Like *7 million people living there* big. However this isn't about my stay, or the more obvious tourist attractions I digested during my stay. Rather, this is about the most interesting and definitive thing one must do should they sojourn in Yangon. And that's going  this spooky ass abandoned amusement park. Being abandoned and all, it's not exactly advertised or pointed out to you. But I'll show ya exactly how I got in tho and save you the hassle ðŸ˜Ž

### Finding your way in
Here's another picture of a map. The blue pin is where I entered the amusement park: it's at the back of a parking lot on the southwest corner of the Yangon zoo and it should be full of vans, buses, taxis, etc.

Tourists pass through this way to enter all the time, so don't worry about making a fuss or disturbing the people working in and around the lot; it's a perfectly normal scene. Upon reaching the back right corner of the parking lot, you should see a fence falling apart with a large gap you could just walk right pass. Do that, and say 'Mingalabar' to the (mostly) harmless stray dogs guarding the spot. You're in. 

### In the amusement park
There's something surreal and oddly enjoyable about this type of urban exploration, beholding what amounts to modern ruins. I won't get too into the history of the amusement park, but suffice it to say, it's super abandoned now, and nobody seems to have cleaned up any of it - really. You could easily spend 1 hour+ just exploring the grounds, getting lost and stumbling upon new parts of the park.

From abandoned merry-go-rounds, bumper cars, and arcades, you might mistake yourself for having walked onto the set of some post-apocalyptic zombie film. But, alas you would be mistaken, as the area still harbors life - a bunch of people still live there on the park grounds, squatters included. I caught some of them cooking up a meal on an open fire - they were super friendly and said hello, per usual in Myanmar.

But perhaps the highlight of the whole park, (aside from the broken glass stuck in my shoe soles and the all the e-dust inhaled from scattered broken electronic components in the giant arcade) must've been this pirate ship ride. It must be the only ride in the park which is still semi-operation (you just gotta have someone rock you when you're on it, just image a swinge but 200x bigger). We were even able to scavenge the cap'n himself and prop him onto the deck! And who says American tourists are rude? ðŸ˜…

### Yangon in general
Zooming back out into Yangon itself, I don't think it has anything special to offer for travelers to Myanmar. Sure, they have the famous [Shwedagon Pagoda](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Shwedagon_Pagoda), and you could call me a blasphemous heretic but that just doesn't cut it for me. Myanmar must have tens of thousands of pagodas, from the most remote mountainside villages to other major cities. I wouldn't go out of my way to stop there, but, should you be like many travelers and find yourself in Yangon, either having just flown in, or passing through, don't overlook this gem of urban decay / urban exploration. It truly became my justification for passing through the city. But wait, [isn't there a website dedicated to just the sort of vibe?](https://www.atlasobscura.com/)

Happy travels :)
