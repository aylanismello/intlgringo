# Pura Vida, Mae! (the way Ticos talk) ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡·

As any Spanish speaker knows, native or not, Spanish comes in a level of variety hardly seen in any other language. The Costa Rican dialect, more specifically, the San JosÃ© dialect I picked up during my time there, is no different.

This is by no means an exhaustive list, and I am no means even <10% sure of these, but there are some pretty common expressions I caught along the way spending time with Costa Ricans that stood out. Such as...

## Tico
This one's easy. It's what Costa Ricans call themselves colloquially. Legend has it that it comes from their propensity to 'ticoify' words. That is to say, substitute the standard -cito diminutive suffix with -tico. However, this is not unique to Costa Rican Spanish, so don't take my word for this explanation.


` Por supesto soy ` **Tico** ` - naci en Costa Rica, verdad?`
> Of course I'm Costa Rican - I was born in Costa Rica, right?

*also just for fun, this is how we'd use the aforementioned -tico as the diminutive*

` Solo dame un ` **pocitico** `de cafe, porfa, tengo que acostarme luego.`
> Only give me a little bit of coffe please, I need to sleep soon.

## Mae
Call it mate, bro, dude, lad - this is that one word that every guy under the age of 30 says every minute to refer to other humans. You can't help but get washed away in the deluges of 'maes' you hear if you let your ears adjust for a second and just listen in public.

`Vaya ` **mae** `-  soy tan Tico!`
> Wow, dude - I'm so Costa Rican!
> 
`Creo que Ashton Kutcher es el rei de todo los ` **maes**.
> I think that Ashton Kutcher is the king of all dudes.

## Chiva
Dope, sick, cool, wicked, rad(strikethrough) (ok fair enough, I don't think anyone says rad non-ironically nowadays). As far as I know this is super specific to Costa Rican spanish, but I've been wrong about ways to say cool crossing borders before.

`Ese blog del gringo es demasiado  ` **chiva** ` mae!`
> That gringo's blog is too dope bro!

## Pura Vida
Pura Vida is one of the expressions that could mean so many things that it means nothing. I was constantly surprised by the siutations in which it could be applied. These examples are actually experienes I had with term during my Costa Rican travels.

Case 1:
all good, fine

***reception worker***: `Como estÃ¡?`
> How you doing?
> 
***airbnb host***: `Pura vida!`
> All good!

Case 2: 
no worries, don't mention it
***dude driving, lost***: `Gracias por la ayuda`
> Thanks for the help!

***stranger off the road who helped us be less lost***: `Pura vida!`
> No worries, we straight

Case 3 - â™¾:

To be honest, I walked away from Pura Visa understanding it less than when I go there. Just say it as a placehoder, even if you're usage is way off, you'll inevitably be loved by the people for using the beloved motto of the nation!

## Soda
This is a Costa Rican take on the classic American diner. No road trip is complete without a stop on the roadside Soda, where you could get an assortment of traditional Tico dishes. But besdies that, you could really find these anywhere.

`Ayer tuvimos hambre, asÃ­ que hemos parado en un` Soda `para almozar`
> Yesterday we were hungry, so we stopped at a sode to have lunch.





### A note on `tÃº` usage in Costa Rica:
In sharp contrast to the rest of Central America, and from most of the Spanish speaking world for that matter, the usage of the third person pronoun `tu` is frowned upon, and it almost never appopriate for use even in casual conversation with friends.

On the plus side, if you're learning Spanish and only plan to go to Costa Rica, that's one less conjugation set to learn right?
