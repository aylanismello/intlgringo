# 1-way flight to Chiang Mai (time for a Southeast Asia Trip)

Many moons ago, when I was still speculative about the whole [digital nomad](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/911muc/digital_nomad_life_coach_starter_pack/) thing, I decided to book a 1 way ticket to Medellin, Colombia. Medellin had developed a near cult status in the digital nomad community as the mecca of South American cities. Plus, I was sure my limited Spanish could vastly improve, and maybe, if I had time, I could hop around to some neighboring countries. Just for a bit.

Well, that was the original plan anyhow. 

That turned into what may have been the single most feature filled, impactful trip of my life, encompassing nearly all of South America all the way up to central Mexico. I still have yet to dig into all my old photos and write some reflective posts, but - one trip at a time!

###Times they are a changin
The trip made me totally rethink why I travel, what a trip can be, but maybe most importantly - how to keep moving without losing motivation, money, or burning out. That being said, this time I've decided to make a few changes. For starters, I have packed over 65% less, traveling with only the things you see here.

Also, I've kept my travel schedule as flexible as possible. There's no rush to visit X amount of countries in Y time, nor is there some large commitment to stay put in any one place for any fixed amount of time.

If all goes to plan (or the lack thereof), these countries should be thorughly hit up by yours truly in the upcoming months. Take note that I've never been to any of these, not even for a layover.

- China 🇨🇳
- Thailand 🇹🇭
- Cambodia 🇰🇭
- Laos 🇱🇦
- Vietnam 🇻🇳
- Burma 🇲🇲

Some potential contendors, but ones I'm not totally sure about

- the Phillipines 🇵🇭
- Indonesia 🇮🇩
- Malaysia 🇲🇾

Whew, so that would be 9 new countries! (yes, I am seeing some of these flags for the first time just typing in these emojis)

So first, off to Chiang Mai to get some bearings and the region. Let's do it.
