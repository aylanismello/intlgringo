# The Sunrise Economy of Bagan

Imagine a national park dedicated to ancient Buddhist ruins, where the park and modernity live side by side, where you are essentially situated in the park and there's no distinction between inside the ruins and out. Imagine 25 strangers from around the world, spread out on the top of a temple untouched for hundreds of years, all eager to share a sunrise of an incredible landscape teeming with locals villages, rows of temples, large and small, and rolling morning colors.

Sounds romantic doesn't it? I call Bagan, Myanmar a Sunrise Economy town, but this is a bit of a misnomer. Sunsets are equally as important.

### Not yo granmama's ruins. This is CYOA

Ok, I lied. There is a minor distinction inside of Bagan vs. the outside world. You have to enter what they call the Bagan archaeological zone, a privilege which will set you back (25,000 kyat / 15$ USD) for 3 days in the zone. But once you're in, most of the fun isn't derived from just visiting the largest, most impressive temples. It's really the journey, exploring, getting lost off the beaten path, and discovering one of the many temples around.

### 3,000 temples and counting

[UNESCO counted 3000](www.wikiwand.com) temples in the Bagan archaeological zone. Unfortunately, they're collapsing at an alarmingly high rate. Last year, according to one of my local guides, 300 temples collapsed. Put another way, that's 10% gone just like that.
