# The Sunrise Economy of Bagan, Myanmar

The business model of Bagan, on first glance, sounds fantastically romantic. The advertised attraction is an enormous archaeological zone of Buddhist ruins, ranging in size from humbly small to rivaling large cathedrals. But, the real main attraction here is partaking is some of the most incredible sunrises and sunsets you've ever seen. As you're lying there in the spot which you've happened upon, whether it be a quiet patch of field or on the roof of one of the 2,500+ temples in the area, you're sure to be taken aback sharing a sunrise of this incredible landscape teeming with local villages, rows of temples, and rolling morning colors. (Not to mention the picturesque hot air balloons).

I say that Bagan is a 'Sunrise Economy', but this is a bit of a misnomer. Sunsets are equally as important.

### Not your grandma's ruins. This is CYOA

Other ruins usually charge a fee to enter, but you head out at closing time. Bagan is a bit different, since the ruins are so vast you technically pay to enter the city itself, which encompasses the ruins and what will be your accommodation. This is what's called the 'Bagan archaeological zone', a privilege which will set you back (25,000 kyat / 15$ USD) for a three day stay. But once you're in, most of the fun isn't derived from just visiting the largest, most impressive temples. In fact, the whole experience works in stark contrast to your highly manicured, zoned-off Chichen Itzas and other large world famous ruins. Bagan is completely CYOA (Choose Your Own Adventure), in the sense that no two trips to Bagan are identical; it's up to you to explore, get lost off the beaten path, and discover the many temples and monuments around. If some other heritage sites and ruins are like highly curated museums, consider Bagan to be more of a playground. Sound lovely, doesn't it?

### The right way to explore

Keeping with the CYOA spirit, you have to grab a method of transport conducive to exploring the terrain. I found the e-bikes they rent out all around town to be the best all-around choice. Since they're not proper motorcycles (albeit similar), they'll rent them out to basically anybody. Take it from me - I've never rode a motorcycle before and I learned how to ride one of them in a few minutes. (Plus, they hardly clock over 60kph so you should be fine even if you fly off your bike ðŸ›µ). I stayed at [BaobaBed Hostel](http://www.baobabedhostelgroup.com/), conveniently located across the street from a few e-bike rental shops - I definitely recommend them if you're staying in the area, the staff's super sweet.

### 2,500 temples (and counting)

[UNESCO counted more than 2,500](https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/819/) temples in the Bagan archaeological zone. Unfortunately, they're collapsing at an alarming rate. Last year, according to one of my local guides, 300 temples collapsed. Put another way, that's more than 10% - gone just like that. But there's more. The open access policy to the temples and monuments is slowly going away as more and more tourists are drawn to the pristine beauty that is Bagan. As my new travel friends and I were exploring around the ruins, we kept on discovering that certain temples (that were just open a few days prior), were all of a sudden barred off, cut off from any sort of access. 

There are a lot of opinions on the topic. On the one hand, tourists pour money into the local economy and help spread the word on the unique cultural heritage that Myanmar possesses. On the other hand, we are undoubtedly speeding up the decay and destruction of these ancient, sacred sites. All that is to say that -

### Bagan is changing. Fast. -so go now.

Seriously. I literally saw a temple close down in real time - after witnessing a glorious sunrise atop one of the temples that my crew and I were recommended by a local guide, we were greeted by a local government official who, aside of  trying to sell tacky artwork, also informed us that access to the temple we were standing on would be stop indefinitely starting the next day.

Tacky art for sale, or announcement that the party's over? 

This isn't some sort of future premonition, this is happening now. Very soon the CYOA nature of Bagan will give way to something much more walled off and pre-determined. The local government is taking very real measures to close down entrance to various temples, at a rate that seems to be accelerating. If you're planning a SE Asia trip, or just want to get one of a kind experience in timeless spot, head to Bagan now.

### But what about the Hot Air Balloons?

What is there really to say about them? They cost more than 300$ USD and are run by Brits. I'll pass, with that money I could fly around SE Asia for a few months.

### Updates + Looking ahead

I am really interested in knowing the fate of Bagan as it continues to change long after the blog post. Please comment any sort of updates below, and I'll try to edit this article as well to reflect the most current situation.
