# The Good, the Bad, and the South of Thailand

My first day in Bangkok I had a conversation that I don't think I'll ever forget. And while we're country calling (we weren't), it was with a Brit (surprise!).

He had just come back from Khao San road - a tacky, mostly tourist-focused street world famous for its backpacker friendliness and ping-pong shows (if you don't know what ping-pong shows are yet, Google it. I'm not linking to that.) Exhausted, and clearly happy to be back at the hostel to rest, he began to describe how his night had went. 

>  Well, it was alright you know. It's just - it's Khao San road and there were just too many Thai. Non enough westerners, you know what I mean?

> You do know we are in Thailand though, right?

> Yeah but I wasn't feeling the vibe though. Just too many Thai people out tonight, I wanted to get on some Western action.

This back and forth encapsulates the current state of Thai tourism. It has, to wax clich√©, become a victim of its own success. There is an expectation to be in the country, yet in a weird cultural limbo where all your western needs and amenities are met, and heaven forbid you learn more than a Lonely Planet scrap's worth of Thai phrases.

But nowhere is this more in your face and evident than in the South of Thailands\, with world famous islands such as Ko Phi Phi and Ko Tao drawing comparisons to paradise, or if you ask me, draw comparison to a Western European packed Ryan Air flight.



# Ok, wrap up

You say you can't knock it until you've tried it. Well, knock it the fuck out. I don't need to stay in rustic villages full of locals and homestay to feel like I'm in a country, but when the European tourists outnumber locals what feels like 5-1, I'm not in paradise. I'm in Denmark without the shit weather.

Peace.
