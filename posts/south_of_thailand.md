# The Good, the Bad, and the South of Thailand

My first day in Bangkok, as I was winding down in my hostel, I had a conversation that I don't think I'll ever forget. 

This brit had just come back from Khao San road - a tacky, mostly tourist-focused street world famous for its cheap buckets of liquor, backpacker friendliness, and ping-pong shows (if you don't know what ping-pong shows are yet, Google it. I'm not linking to that.) Exhausted, and clearly happy to be back at the hostel to rest, he began to describe how his night had went. 

>  Well, it was alright you know. It's just - it's Khao San road and there were just too many Thai people. Not enough westerners, you know what I mean?

> You do know we are in Thailand though, right?

> Yeah but I wasn't feeling the vibe though. Just too many Thai people out tonight, I wanted to get in on some Western action.

This back and forth encapsulates the current state of Thai tourism. It has, to wax clich√©, become a victim of its own success. There is an expectation to be physically in the country, while simultaneously be have all your western needs and amenities met as if you never left home. 

But nowhere is this more evident than in the south of Thailand, whose world famous islands and beaches have drawn so many tourists that they largely outnumber locals by (insert x) 5-1 in the high season. Especially after the tragic 2004 South Indian tsunami, many of these islands were completely redeveloped from the ground up, opting for large scale resorts, subtracting from what must've been what gave the islands their original appeal.

Fast forward to 2019 and I'm on a ferry to Ko Phi Phi, and as we disembark at the ferry terminal it feels more like I'm in the gate of a Ryan Air flight than in Southeast Asia. 

There's no denying that these islands, while crowded, pandering to European tourists, and largely bereft of any of their original culture, still have natural beauty and decent beaches. But to that claim I counter that there are many other Thai islands at least equally as idyllic without the feeling of being en route to Geneva as you walk down the pier to your hotel. 

And maybe that's the mistake I made. My intiution told me that I wouldn't like the Thai islands because of all the reasons I listed above. I had heard the stories and the complaints at how the island ha.... I wanted to go in with an open mind, I wanted to see for myself. But it turns out traveling isn't a checklist, you don't "have" to go somewhere anymore than you need to watch shitty movies or listen to shit music just because they're recommended . 



#Ok, wrap up

You say you can't knock it until you've tried it. Well, knock it the fuck out. I don't need to stay in rustic villages full of locals and homestay to feel like I'm in a country, but when the European tourists outnumber locals what feels like 5-1, I'm not in paradise. I'm in Denmark without the shit weather.

Here's a list of Thai islands that seem to be a lot more low key and that I look forward to check out when I have a chance.
