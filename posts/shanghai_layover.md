En route to Thailand it appeared as though I'd have a 15+ hour layover. Thinking I'd have to go through the mountain of work/time it takes to acquire a Chinese visa, I decided long before that I'd hang out in the airport in lieu of exploring the city. You know, maybe make friends with 3-4 cushioned seats and call it a night. That was before I heard about the 24-hour temporary visa granted to those with layovers.

### It's easy. Just head to the correct line

There are two distinct lines for tourits entering the countries, the longer one is for those entering proper, with a visa issued in their respective countries of origin. In a layover situation, you want to head for the `24/144-hour Transit Area` line. The process is very simple and costs nothing - you just need proof of your connecting flight in form of an e-ticket, etc. Then just hang out in this line with the other foreigners and prepare for layover exploration greatness!

Make sure to find/fill out the appropriate immigration paperwork before it's your turn in line, as I didn't see them passed out on the plane (probably since it's a special type of visa, also I was passed the fuck out). Then, voil√†! Welcome to China! Or, at least [the province where the visa was granted for the time alloted](https://www.travelchinaguide.com/embassy/visa/free-72hour/).

### GTFO - and fast

First thing's first, you gotta get yourself out of the airport. Since time is of the essence with a layover, find your way over to the Maglev train. At speeds up to a blazing 300+ km/hr, this is the fastest way to connect to rest of the city. It costs around 12$ USD / 80 Chinese Yuan for a roundtrip ticket, economy class. Last train outbound is around 11PM, first train back is at 7:03AM. At Longyang Road station (the first stop), you could transfer to the metro, where the entire city will be at your disposal.

But this is where I got severely confused. With no access to wifi at the airport (China's wifi, from my limited experience, is not great), and unwilling to purchase the 15-17$ data plan to use for only a few hours, I had no idea which metro stop to get off at. I opted to wing it and just follow the crowds, which actually just led me to meet another American as lost as me - except incredibly more useful (had a data plan). So together, we managed to navigate our way to where we needed to go.

###Metro Time

Although the Shanghai metro system isn't super complex, it's not super straightfoward either. Also - it's cash only. Don't make the same mistake I made (long story short I got dragged through security by some dude into a hallway of one of the subway stations, only to realize my bank was incompatible with the ATM and was then stranded in the station with no card with which to exit the turnstyle).

Luckily, Line 2 (green line) from Longyang Road Station will take you to the more touristy areas, such as the Bund, etc. Hop on, and get off around the Huangpu River (I got off at [East Nanjing Road station](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nanjing+East+Road/@31.2362391,121.4798874,15.36z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x35b2705a3ad72793:0xdd8bb03b6df16d50!8m2!3d31.238101!4d121.484628)). That's where you temporarily enter selfie city üèûüéá

A few beers consumed in public later and I was ready to pass out, luckily the new American homie gifted me a blanket and a floor, for which I was very grateful. Definitely beats the airport cushioned seats. 

Then it was back to Pudong International Airport, this time infinitely easier due to my newfound mastery of the metro system. I'm so glad I went out and explored, so don't squander the opportunity to run out at get lost in Shanghai should you have a layover. Even if it's on the 6-7 hours side, it could definitely be worth your while.
